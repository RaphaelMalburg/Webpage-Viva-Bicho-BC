# Webpage-Viva-Bicho-BC

Webpage developed to help a brazilian NGO in my hometown.

First project, made during the learning process of web develpment basics.
Main goal of the project was to help them get more visibility for their work also to be able to reach out to more people to raise funds.

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and Javascript.

Still some corrections to be made, such as:
 - Making the video stop after out of view
 - Correcting some reponsiveness on the cards section.
